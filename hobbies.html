        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>I enjoy a lot of hobbies. It gives me something different to do depending on my mood, the weather, or time of year (knitting in the summer is really hot!). But there is one hobby I constantly go back to no matter what season: <strong>sewing</strong>. I am a proud owner of 4 sewing machines! Well, 3 sewing machines and 1 serger to be exact. It's a lot but I love them. I haven't gotten around to giving them names but at some point it might just happen.</p>
        <h3>Clothes</h3>
        <img src="images/purple-dress.jpg" alt="Rochelle wearing purple dress with black blazer jacket.">
        <p>I made this bridesmaids dress for a wedding I was in. I was given a purple colour swatch and the rest is history.</p>
        <hr>
        <img src="images/giselle-dress.jpg" alt="Giselle's New York dress from the movie Enchanted.">
        <p>I was Giselle, from Enchanted, for Halloween one year. I used curtains for the floral fabric underneath as a nod to the movie.</p>
        <hr>
        <img src="images/suit-jacket.jpg" alt="Grey and yellow, short sleeve, suit jacket.">
        <p>Yes, I wore this to work multiple times. It's based on a Vogue pattern from the 1960s.</p>
        <h3>Aprons</h3>
        <p>These three aprons were created using a pattern based on a 1950's Vogue style.</p>

        <h3>&amp; More!</h3>
        <img src="images/totoro-toy.jpg" alt="My Neighbour Totoro in felt.">
        <p>I made this little guy for my friend's daughter when she was born.</p>
        <hr>
        <img src="images/star-wars-mobile.jpg" alt="Baby mobile with Star Wars characters in felt.">
        <p>I made this for my son. It attaches to a mobile and it was placed over his crib. The moon was eventually embrodered to say, "C'est n'est pas la lune".</p>
        <hr>
        <img src="images/quilt-bag-1.jpg" alt="Quilted bag with red, teal, and blue large and small pinwheels.">
        <p>I made this drawstring bag for my mom when we went to Disney. It was very popular in the parks.</p>

        <img src="images/pillowcase.jpg" alt="Pillowcase for a body pillow.">
        <p>Pillowcases for body pillows are so expensive! So I bought super cheap twin-sized bed sheets and made a pillowcase. I have enough leftover fabric to make something else, too!</p>
